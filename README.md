# Python Using Tkinter

Tkinter is way for kids
to use GUIs. That creates a
basic window like this:

with just the code:

```python

import tkinter

window = tkinter.Tk()

```

and than you can add stuff to it
like this:

but of course the button doesn't
do anything because we
didn't tell it to do something

```python

import tkinter

window = tkinter.Tk()
                  #defines a button. "window" means
                  #put the button the window, and
                  #"text=" means what the button
                  #should say
button = tkinter.Button(window, text='Press Me')
button.pack()#tells the button to go on the window

```

so I modified it so it would do
something when you click it, and that something was
print "hello world"

and this is the code i used to
make the button print hello world

```python

import tkinter

def do_something():
    print('hello world')

window = tkinter.Tk()

button = tkinter.Button(window, text='Press Me', command=do_something)
button.pack()

```
